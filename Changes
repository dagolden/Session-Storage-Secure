Revision history for Session-Storage-Secure

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for encoding objects as their internal
      representation (i.e. the unblessed data structure)
      instead of throwing an exception (garu)

    - Added support for encoding data structures that are
      unknown/unsupported by Sereal as their stringification,
      instead of throwing an exception (garu)


0.009     2014-04-17 17:15:25-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed bug that would cause custom encoding tests to fail
      intermittently

0.008     2014-04-17 16:29:50-04:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for keeping an array of old keys for decryption
      (Tom Hukins)

    - Added support for replacing MIME::Base64 encoding with user-specified
      transport encoding/decoding, possibly with a custom separator

    [INTERNAL]

    - Update repository support and meta files

0.007     2013-05-31 23:30:44 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Replaced HMAC equality check with a constant-time comparison
      to foil timing attacks

0.006     2013-02-06 22:56:45 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Made MooX::Types::MooseLike prereq explicit to try to address
      prereqs failures by some testers

0.005     2013-02-01 13:55:34 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Added some defensive code to try to avoid test failures on Perl 5.8

0.004     2013-01-25 15:10:34 America/New_York

    [CHANGES]

    - Seeding is now done by Crypt::URandom, which uses the best
      non-blocking source of random data on a given platform, including
      Win32

0.003     2013-01-17 08:47:45 America/New_York

    [BUG FIXES]

    - ISAAC is now seeded from /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random to avoid
      blocking.  urandom is sufficient for seeding a CPRNG that itself is
      generating salt to permute the actual secret key.

0.002     2013-01-15 23:06:47 America/New_York

    [BUG FIXES]

    - Specify MIME::Base64 3.12 as minimum for encode/decode_base64url

    - First release
